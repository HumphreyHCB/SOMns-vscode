# SOMns Language Server and VS Code Client

This project implements a VS Code extension that uses the [Language Server
Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) to connect to
a SOMns language server providing IDE capabilities.

This is somewhat liberally derived from the [VS Code
example](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node-example).
